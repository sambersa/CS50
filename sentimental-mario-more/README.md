The Sentimental Mario More project is a programming exercise where you build a pyramid-like structure of blocks, similar to the classic Mario game. The program prompts the user to input a height, and then prints out a pyramid made of hash (#) characters with that height. The pyramid is aligned to the right, and the blocks must form a proper, symmetrical structure.

The program implements a loop to print the pyramid row by row, with spaces on the left and hash symbols on the right, to create the desired structure. The user is required to input a height that is an integer between 1 and 8. This project tests your understanding of loops, conditionals, and basic string manipulation in Python.

Languages and Technologies Used:

Python: The primary language used to write the program. The logic is implemented using loops to control the structure of each row of the pyramid and ensure proper alignment.
