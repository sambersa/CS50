The Sentimental Cash project is a Python-based application where you implement a program to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount of money. The user inputs an amount (in dollars and cents), and the program outputs the least number of coins needed, using U.S. coin denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). The goal is to help the user make change efficiently by calculating the fewest coins possible.

The program is typically implemented in a greedy manner, meaning you start by using the largest coin denomination (quarter), and then work your way down through smaller denominations (dime, nickel, penny), minimizing the total number of coins. This project tests your ability to use loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic in Python.

Languages and Technologies Used:

Python: The primary language for implementing the logic of calculating the minimum number of coins. The program uses loops to repeatedly subtract coin denominations from the total amount, counting the coins as it goes.
