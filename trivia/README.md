The Trivia project is a web-based quiz game where users are presented with multiple-choice questions and must select the correct answers. The game keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end. Users will interact with a set of questions stored in JavaScript, and the game will show a series of questions one at a time. The goal is to provide feedback to the user about whether their answers were correct or incorrect and to calculate their total score.

You will:

Implement the game logic using JavaScript to handle the display of questions, track the score, and evaluate user input.
Use HTML to structure the game interface, including displaying questions, answer options, and the final score.
Style the game interface with CSS to make the trivia game visually appealing and interactive.
This project challenges you to combine your skills in web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create an engaging, interactive trivia game.

Languages and Technologies Used:

JavaScript: The main language for implementing the game logic. JavaScript will handle user interactions, such as selecting answers and updating the score dynamically.

HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page, including displaying questions and answer choices.

CSS: Used for styling the game, making it visually appealing, and providing feedback on the userâ€™s interactions (e.g., highlighting correct/incorrect answers).
