Inheritance is an object-oriented programming project where you implement classes and use inheritance to model a family tree. Youâ€™ll define classes such as Person and Student that inherit common attributes and behaviors, and then build relationships among them. This project helps you understand core OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while emphasizing the reusability and organization that OOP provides. The project also introduces you to handling files and basic algorithms to process family data.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The main language used for defining structs, simulating inheritance, and implementing memory management. You will also work with pointers and dynamic memory allocation to manage family members and their data.
