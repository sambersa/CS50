The Substitution problem set involves implementing a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using a substitution cipher. In a substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a certain fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

For this project, you will:

Implement a program that takes a keyword (a scrambled version of the alphabet) as a key and uses it to encrypt or decrypt messages.
Write logic to ensure that the user inputs a valid substitution key (which should contain all 26 letters of the alphabet exactly once, ignoring case).
Provide functionality to both encrypt and decrypt messages using the provided key.
The program will perform encryption using the substitution cipher and allow users to both encode and decode messages by shifting the letters based on the provided keyword.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The primary language used for implementing the logic of the substitution cipher. You will work with strings, arrays, and loops to handle the cipherâ€™s encryption and decryption processes. The program will also involve checking the validity of the keyword and the proper substitution of characters.
