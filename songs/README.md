The Songs project is an SQL-based problem where you design and interact with a database to store, search, and retrieve information about songs. You are tasked with building a relational database to manage song records, including their titles, artists, and other relevant details. You will use SQL queries to perform various tasks, such as adding new songs, retrieving song information based on specific criteria, and sorting the data based on certain fields (e.g., song title, artist, etc.).

This project helps you practice using SQL to interact with a database, including creating tables, inserting data, and writing queries for filtering and organizing song data.

Languages and Technologies Used:

SQL (SQLite): The main language used for creating the database, defining tables, and performing queries. You'll be working with SQL statements to add, update, and retrieve song data from the database.
