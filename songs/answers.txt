// If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I'd say they're a very "popular music" kind of person. If this listener has the songs in songs.db
as his top 100 songs, I'd assume they just turn on whatever is popular in the world.

Spotify characterizes 'auras' by color, and I'd definitely characterize this with the color purple




// Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
I've just went out on a limb here and assumed that the listener just listens to whatever's popular in the world.
However, this may not be the case.

If you calculate the danceability, energy and valence from this listener's top 100 songs, you'd get (assuming you round it up to two decimals):
Danceability: 0.72
Energy: 0.66
Valence: 0.48

There is a semi-clear pattern here. This user's top 100 songs may indicate that they prefer songs that are better for dancing
and have a higher energy, however the valence is low, and that's expected because a lot of the top 100 songs are rap songs
and we know what kind of lyrics those songs have (not always).

In conclusion, calculating their aura by using Danceability and the Energy would be more accurate.
