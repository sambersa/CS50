Filter-less is an image-processing project where you create and apply various filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia, reflect, blur, and edge detection) to images. This project mimics photo-editing software by letting users manipulate pixel values to transform the appearance of an image. Each filter involves pixel-by-pixel modifications that allow for different visual effects, challenging you to handle images at a low level.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: Core logic for manipulating pixels, reading, and writing images in bitmap format (BMP).
