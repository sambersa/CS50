         <p id="bio1"> Now this page is pretty boring, I know. However, the next<br>few pages will
             definitely be more entertaining!<br>Anyways, as you already might know, my name is
             Sam Bersa.<br>As of today, I've been coding for around 6 months<br>and it's one of
             the best decisions I have made in my life.<br>I have learned a whole lot and I am
             very glad I started when I did!</p>

         <p id="bio2">I am 22 years old and I live in a small town in Norway.<br>Before taking
                      CS50, I had no experience whatsoever in coding.<br>As said, I have now
                      been coding for around 6 months and I feel like I have<br>learned a lot
                      of new things in that time.</p>
         </p>

         <p id="bio3">My hobbies are: Football, Music, Working out and Coding of course.<br>You'll get to read
                      more about them later on, if you decide to do so!<br>My ultimate goal as of right now is to
                      learn a lot more about coding in general<br>get better at it and hopefully land a job. Anyways, I do not want
                      to take up<br> too much of your time with this very boring biography,<br> so feel free to explore my homepage!</p>

         <p id="bio4">Below you'll find two links where you can find me!<br> I do not have too many socials, so
                      I'll only put a link to my Instagram and my Git.<br> I hope you enjoyed the very long read!</p>
