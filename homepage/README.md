The Homepage project involves designing and developing a personal website using web development technologies. The goal is to create a static webpage that showcases a personal profile, portfolio, or any relevant content. This project emphasizes HTML, CSS, and the principles of responsive web design to ensure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. You will build a homepage that features sections like a brief introduction, a list of projects or hobbies, and links to external resources, while focusing on styling and layout techniques.
