The Readability problem set is a program that calculates the readability of a text using the Coleman-Liau index. This index estimates the U.S. school grade level required to understand a given text. The program analyzes the text by counting the number of letters, words, and sentences, and then applies a mathematical formula to compute the index. The goal is to help assess the complexity of a piece of writing, making it easier to understand for different audiences. The program requires handling string input and performing calculations based on the text's content.
