The Sentimental Credit project involves writing a program that determines whether a credit card number is valid based on the Luhn algorithm (also known as the modulus 10 algorithm). The program checks whether a given credit card number is valid and identifies its type (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, or American Express).

The Luhn algorithm works by performing a series of operations on the digits of the card number, including doubling every second digit from the right, summing all the digits, and verifying if the sum is divisible by 10. If the card number is valid, the program also checks the starting digits to classify the card type. For example, a Visa card typically starts with a 4, a MasterCard with a 5, and an American Express with a 3.

Languages and Technologies Used:

Python: The primary language used to implement the logic of the Luhn algorithm and check the validity of the credit card number. The program uses loops and conditionals to process the digits of the number, sum them appropriately, and check the card type.
