The Volume project is a program that allows users to adjust the volume of an image or video file using a waveform or sound manipulation technique. In this project, you will be working with image processing to increase or decrease the volume (or brightness, in the case of images) of an input file. Specifically, you will be given a file format (such as a .bmp image) and asked to modify pixel values to brighten or darken the image based on user input.

The core task is to:

Read an image file.
Modify the pixels' brightness or volume based on user input.
Output a new image file with the adjusted brightness (or volume).
The project involves image manipulation through pixel adjustments based on formulas, like multiplying pixel values to brighten or darken the image.
This project provides a hands-on introduction to how images are represented in memory and how algorithms can be applied to change pixel values to achieve desired effects.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The primary language for reading and manipulating image data. The project will involve manipulating pixel values in memory, using pointers and loops to adjust brightness (or volume) and writing the modified data back to a new file.
