Caesar is a classic cryptography project where you implement a Caesar cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher. This program encrypts text by shifting each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions. This basic project teaches string manipulation and modular arithmetic, laying the foundation for understanding more complex encryption methods.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: Implementing the Caesar cipher logic, including string manipulation and use of ASCII values for letter shifting.
