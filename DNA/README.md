The DNA project is a bioinformatics exercise that involves identifying a person based on their DNA sequence. You are given a DNA sequence and a database of individualsâ€™ genetic markers and must determine the individual by matching patterns of short tandem repeats (STRs) within the sequence. This project introduces concepts in pattern matching and basic data manipulation.

Languages and Technologies Used:

Python: Main language for file handling, string manipulation, and pattern matching in DNA sequences.

CSV (Comma-Separated Values): Handling input data with individual STR counts for each person.
