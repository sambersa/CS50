The Plurality project is a voting simulation program that allows users to run an election with multiple candidates. The goal is to determine the winner based on a plurality voting system, where each voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins. The program uses an array of structures to store candidate information and votes. After collecting votes from users, the program counts the votes and determines the winner or identifies if there's a tie. This project challenges you to implement basic data structures like arrays, as well as logic for handling ties and ensuring valid input.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The primary language used for implementing the election system, including defining candidate structures, managing votes, and using loops and conditional statements to tally results and determine the winner.
