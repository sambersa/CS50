The Recover project involves recovering lost JPEG files from a raw disk image. The disk image simulates a corrupted storage medium, where multiple JPEG files are fragmented across the disk. Your task is to write a program that identifies the start of each JPEG file, extracts the data, and saves each JPEG as a separate file. The project involves reading and interpreting the disk image byte by byte, detecting JPEG signatures, and handling file writing. This exercise teaches file handling, low-level data processing, and the manipulation of binary data in C.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The primary language used for reading the raw disk image, detecting JPEG file headers, and writing recovered files. You will work with file pointers and byte-level manipulation, handling binary data efficiently.
