CS50's Finance project is a web application that simulates a stock trading platform, allowing users to "buy" and "sell" stocks based on real-time prices. Users start with a virtual cash balance and can use it to build a stock portfolio, tracking the value of their holdings as market prices fluctuate. Key features include user authentication, stock lookup functionality, transaction history tracking, and a personal portfolio dashboard showing real-time stock information and cash balance.

The project also involves managing a SQLite database to record user data, transactions, and stock information, ensuring secure and accurate data handling. The Finance project requires implementing both backend logic and frontend user interface design, blending coding and finance principles.


Languages and Technologies Used:

Python: Core logic, particularly with Flask, which serves as the backend web framework.

HTML: For structuring the web pages.

CSS: For styling the web pages to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: For dynamic behavior on the frontend, like updating stock prices and forms.

SQL (SQLite): For database management, handling user accounts, transaction records, and stock portfolio data.

Jinja: Flask's templating engine used to inject Python code into HTML for dynamic page content.
