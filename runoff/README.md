The Runoff project implements an election system that uses the runoff voting method, which is a ranked-choice voting system. In runoff voting, voters rank candidates in order of preference, and the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated in each round until one candidate remains. The program simulates this process by collecting votes, counting the number of votes for each candidate, eliminating candidates with the fewest votes, and redistributing the votes based on voters' next preferences. The program uses a structured approach to store and manipulate votes and candidate information, and it implements a loop that continues until a winner is determined.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The main language used for implementing the runoff voting system. You will use arrays and structs to store candidates and votes, as well as loops and conditional statements to simulate the elimination process.
