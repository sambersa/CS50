This repository contains my solutions to the CS50 problem sets, which are part of Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course (CS50). The course is designed to teach fundamental concepts of computer science, programming, and software engineering. Each problem set challenges me to apply these concepts in a variety of practical ways, with projects in languages such as C, Python, JavaScript, and SQL.

**Problem Set Breakdown:**

**Algorithms:** Implementing and understanding key algorithms like sorting, searching, and encryption.

**Data Structures:** Working with arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and more.

**Web Development:** Creating interactive web apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Databases:** Designing and querying relational databases using SQL.

**File I/O:** Handling file input/output for processing data and files in various formats.

**Image Processing:** Manipulating images or video files using algorithms.


**Technologies Used**
**C:** Low-level programming, memory management, and data manipulation.

**Python:** High-level programming for tasks involving strings, numbers, and algorithms.

**JavaScript/HTML/CSS:** Web development to create interactive applications.

**SQL:** Database querying and management with relational databases.
