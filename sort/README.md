The Sort project involves implementing several sorting algorithms in C to sort an array of integers. The goal is to understand and implement different algorithms such as Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort, and analyze their efficiency in terms of time complexity.

You are required to:

Implement each sorting algorithm to arrange a list of numbers in ascending order.
Compare the algorithms in terms of performance.
Test the algorithms on different sizes of data sets and measure how long it takes for each algorithm to complete.
The project also includes performance analysis, requiring you to consider how different sorting algorithms perform with varying input sizes. Understanding the time complexity of the algorithms (e.g., 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ) for Selection Sort and Bubble Sort, and 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn) for Merge Sort) is key to evaluating their efficiency.

Languages and Technologies Used:

C: The primary language for implementing the sorting algorithms. You will work with arrays, loops, and conditional statements to implement and test the sorting algorithms.
