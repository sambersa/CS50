The Movies project is focused on creating and managing a movie database using SQL. In this project, you will design and implement a database to store and retrieve information about movies, such as their titles, release years, genres, and ratings. The challenge involves using SQL to interact with the database to insert, update, and query data. You'll be required to write various SQL queries to handle tasks like listing movies by genre, finding the highest-rated films, and performing other operations that demonstrate your understanding of relational databases.

Languages and Technologies Used:

SQL (SQLite): Primary language for creating and managing the database, including creating tables, inserting data, and writing queries to retrieve and manipulate movie data.
